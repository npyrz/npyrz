## Who am I?
I'm a 15 year old High School student from Chicago, and I plan on studying Computer Science. I'm a HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, EJS, Node.js, SQL Web Developer and I plan on learning many more other languages. I first started coding when I was 13 years old and started by making a discord bot and then I made my first own basic website. After that I gradually started learning more and now I'm addicted to coding and learning new things!

## Courses/Services
I currently do courses for HTML, CSS, SCSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Handlebars, EJS, Node.js, SQL and discord.js, once I learn more languages I will add them to the list. All of the courses cost ($10.00 Dollars USD), if you have any questions feel free to message me on discord or send me an email. I will also be taking any requests for services for me to work on projects that you need completed. This will also cost will vary from being free to up $20.00 - 25.00 USD, nothing will be higher than that, if you have any questions feel free to message me. All prices depend on how much work needs to be done on the project/service. It also depends on if the project needs a hosting or needs any special programs for it. In addition, I also look into factor on other given prices by other developers and try to lower the price to a perfect liking. If you would like the project to be done on a certain date/time then you will need to notify me with the purchase so I can start working on it as soon as possible!
