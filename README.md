I'm a High School student planning to have a career in Aviation ✈️. I always love to expand my knowledge and learn about new technologies and tools 🔨.  Exploring different ways to solve problems has always been a big part of me to this day. Currently, I do a lot of Discord Bot Development 👨🏻‍💻 and trying to learn some more Vue 👀.
